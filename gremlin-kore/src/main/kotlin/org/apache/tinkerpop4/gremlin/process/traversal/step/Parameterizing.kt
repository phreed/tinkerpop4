/**
 * An interface for [Step] implementations that hold a [Parameters] object, which fold in arguments from
 * other steps. It is typically used on mutating steps, such as `addV()`, where calls to `property(k,v)`
 * are folded in as parameters to that add vertex step, but it may be used for any step that could benefit from
 * modulation.
